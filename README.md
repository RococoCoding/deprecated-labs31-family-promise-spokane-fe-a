# Getting Started

### User Flows

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/NWATDZ3U/labs-31-family-promise-a)
[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/family-promise-of-spokane-labs-31-BNvk4uvz2LtHZa1W3pyhuM)

Each user should have one associated role determining which features are available to them. Flows should be designed to accommodate the addition of more user roles in the future.

Our product supports the following user roles:

- Executive Director
- Supervisor: Responsible for handling the day-to-day needs of the guests at the shelter, including conducting intakes of new families.
- Case Manager: Writes case notes on guests the shelter is serving as they work with them.
- Guest : A "head of household" arriving to or checked into the shelter as part of a family unit of some kind.

and the following user stories:
- As a Supervisor I need guest signatures so I can confirm they agree to the rules and regulations.
- As a Supervisor, I want access to predictive data so I can identify what areas/services to focus on for a successful outcome. 
- As a Guest I need an easy way to log in to my profile so I can view and update my information. 
- As an Executive Director, I need a dashboard to hold the relevant information so I can have ease of access.

### Key Features

- Supervisors can Create guest account
- Case Manager can view guest profile 
- Case Manager can view the exit destination prediction
- Guest can be flagged for misconduct
- Notes can be added to guests' profiles
- Guest can view their own profile

(Labs 31 Team Contributions)
- Guests can sign documents through embedded signing with DocuSign
- Guests can log in with Facebook or Google
- Executive Director can view data science analytics visualizations through their dashboard
